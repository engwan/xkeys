# xkeys

An Nodejs/NPM module to interact with the X-keys panels.

Disclaimer: This module is very young and should not be used in production yet!

Licence: MIT

The project is based on the documentation available here: http://xkeys.com/PISupport/DeveloperHIDDataReports.php

## Installation

`$ npm install --save xkeys`



## Getting started

### JavaScript

```javascript

const XKeys = require('xkeys');

var myXkeysPanel = new XKeys();

// Listen to pressed keys:
myXkeysPanel.on('down', keyIndex => {
	console.log('Key pressed: '+keyIndex);
	myXkeysPanel.setBacklight(keyIndex, true);
});
// Listen to released keys:
myXkeysPanel.on('up', keyIndex => {
	console.log('Key released: '+keyIndex);

	myXkeysPanel.setBacklight(keyIndex, false);
});

// --- Experimental functions ---
// The functions below are implemented, but not tested with any hardware yet.
//

myXkeysPanel.on('jog', deltaPos => {
	console.log('Jog position has changed: '+deltaPos);
});
myXkeysPanel.on('shuttle', shuttlePos => {
	console.log('Shuttle position has changed: '+shuttlePos);
});
myXkeysPanel.on('joystick', position => {
	console.log('Joystick has changed:'+position); // {x, y, z}
});

```

## Documentation

### Initalize
#### Connect to any connected X-keys panel
```javascript
const XKeys = require('xkeys');

var myXkeysPanel = new XKeys();
```
#### Connect to a specific X-keys panel
```javascript
const HID = require('node-hid');
const XKeys = require('xkeys');

const devices = HID.devices();
const connectedXKeys = devices.filter(device => {
	return (device.vendorId === XKeys.vendorId && device.usage === 1); // Make sure that the usage-property is set to 1
});

if (connectedXKeys.length) {
	var myXkeysPanel = new XKeys(connectedXKeys[0].path);
} else {
	console.log("Could not find any connected X-keys panels.");
}

```

### Events

* 'downKey' & 'upKey': Triggered when a regular button is pressed/released. Emitted with (keyIndex).
* 'downAlt' & 'upAlt': Triggered when an alternative button is pressed/released, such as the "program switch" (keyIndex 'PS'). Emitted with (keyIndex).
* 'down' & 'up': Triggered when ANY button is pressed/released. Emitted with (keyIndex).

* 'jog': Triggered when the jog wheel is moved. Emitted with (jogValue)
* 'shuttle': Triggered when the shuttle is moved. Emitted with (shuttleValue)
* 'joystick': Triggered when the joystick is moved. Emitted with ({x, y, z})

* 'error': Triggered on error. Emitted with (error).


### Setting things
#### Set backlight of a button
```javascript
.setBacklight(keyIndex, on, redLight, flashing);

// Examples:
// Light up the backlight of bank 1 (blue light)
.setBacklight(keyIndex, true);
// Flash the backlight of bank 2 (red light)
.setBacklight(keyIndex, true, true, true);
```

#### Set the LEDs (the red/green status LED's)
```javascript
.setLED(keyIndex, on, flashing)

// Examples:
// Light up the green LED
.setLED(0, true);
// Light up the red LED
.setLED(1, true);
```

#### Set backlight intensity
```javascript
.setBacklightIntensity(intensity)

// Example:
// Set max intensity
.setBacklightIntensity(255)
```

#### Set all backlights on or off
```javascript
.setAllBacklights(on, redLight)

// Example:
// Light up all buttons
.setAllBacklights(true, false)
.setAllBacklights(true, true)
```

#### Set flashing frequency
```javascript
// The frequency can be set to 1-255, where 1 is fastest and 255 is the slowest.
// 255 is approximately 4 seconds between flashes.
.setFrequency(frequency)

// Example:
// Set the frequency to a pretty fast flash
.setFrequency(8)
```


## Device support

Testing and contributions are much appreciated!
If you have one of the untested devices below, please test it and tell us how it works in an Issue!

### Supported devices
These devices have been tested to work:

* XK-24
* XK-80
* XK-68 Jog + Shuttle

### Not tested devices (yet)

Support for these devices is implemented, but not tested:

* XK-60: Not tested
